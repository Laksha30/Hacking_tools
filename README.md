# Hacking_tools
Tools that I tried to build on my own for practice.

All the tools have been written in python3.

You can download the file and run it in terminal using "python3 <filename> <arguments>".
  
Every tool has a "--help" command to know more about the tool. 
  
      Disclaimer: All these tools are built for the process of learning to write scripts/code. 
  
  Let me know the other features that can be added to the existing tools! 
  
  Happy hacking!
